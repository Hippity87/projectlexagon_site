            I'm an engineering student (estimated graduation by summer '26) with
            currently 4.37 GPA and I have completed my practical training in the IT Department of Satakunta University of Applied Sciences, Pori. At SAMK I gained experience with
            M365, IDM, LLM-technologies, web development and general IT-support. I managed to to also write some programming code for the frontend of SAMK's student and faculty intranet.
            Being able to do some programming was nice, because I love programming. My strongest foundation is C#. JavaScript and Python compliment this.

            My latest personal projects have been focused on web development and AI. I have built several web applications using modern frameworks and libraries,
            integrating AI models to enhance functionality.
            I'm particularly interested in how AI can be leveraged to create more intuitive and responsive user experiences, especially with vision-based AI applications. A recent example of this is the "Minni-luokittelija" project, where I developed a web app that classifies images of dogs using a Custom Vision AI model. Cloud technologies are also of interest to me, is why I chose to deploy the app on Microsoft Azure.

            Outside of tech: I have a Bachelor's in BA. I have a large skillset
            that combines audio-visual tools and skills from photography to
            composing and mixing music.
