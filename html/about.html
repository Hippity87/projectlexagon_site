          <p>
            I'm an engineering student (estimated graduation by end of '26) and
            currently 4.27 GPA and well ahead in my studies. I love programming
            and my strongest foundation is C#. JavaScript and Python compliment
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm aspiring to become a Full Stack-developer and my goal now is to
            build a Proof-Of-Concept solution of this surrounding my game
            development in Unity. ETA for completion is by the end of 2025.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Outside of tech: I have a Bachelor's in BA. I have a large skillset
            that combines audio-visual tools and skills from photography to
            composing and mixing music.
