    //         <h2>QuantumConnect Details</h2>
    //         <p>I participated in a competition this spring called CERN Spring Campus 2025. The idea was to provide a bot-algorithm and make the bots play against each other on a live server. I came in third in the competition, with no prior experience with Java or such algorithmic bots that use heuristics like MCTS. I will not lie-- I used all the AI tools I could to my advantage and the results were great. I learned a lot and the experience of developing and competing on the leaderboards was addictive to say the least.

            <h2>Amp & Cabinet Details</h2>
            <p>This is a custom-built amplifier and cabinet that I designed and built with my dad. The actual amp is from an 80s Fender "The Twin", but the cabinet elements were swapped with vintage Celestion G10S-50's.

            <p>The build process included CAD-plans(thanks dad), choosing of materials, 3D-printing the amplifier and cabinet feet, and the obvious craftmanship by us that included some carpentry and tailoring.</p>

            <p>Also some electrical wiring and soldering was done to make amplifier connectivity possible, both parallel and series.</p>
